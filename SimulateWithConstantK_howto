set parameter adiabatic to 0 and control the length of the simulation by TSim with coupling strength given by Kstart

ALSO: set specified_distribution to a value unequal from zero to fix the distribution of intrinsic frequencies for all cases in that run!

modify the initial state according to whether we start at low R, i.e., the incoherent state or large R, i.e., the synced state

--> calculate the global frequency of the synced state using the mean intrinsic frequency and assuming no phase-differences, or relax that state on the first run
