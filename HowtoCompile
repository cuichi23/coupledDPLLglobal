The distutils extension provided with Cython allows you to pass .pyx files directly to the Extension constructor in your setup file.

If you have a single Cython file that you want to turn into a compiled extension, say with filename example.pyx the associated setup.py would be:

from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules = cythonize("example.pyx")
)

To understand the setup.py more fully look at the official distutils documentation. To compile the extension for use in the current directory use:

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
